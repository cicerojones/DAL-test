staring down the barrel of a designer handgun
---------------------------------------------

i built for investors
things very special to me:
drops in the consumer bucket.

i stripped off their flesh
while the officers laughed.
i tried to imagine them as a bird would.

heedless of chemical sands
the nest inside my ear
started to say something,
and suddenly it hit me:

i wonâ€™t help you.
i am a dadaist artist.
