weeks after I rediscovered John Nesky's <A
HREF="http://www.beepbox.co/">beepbox</A> and started using
it frequently.

<p>
The title is an implied complaint about being stuck on some slow train
home, probably coming back from dinner. Making a little beepbox tune
afterwards was an easy way to relax my jangled nerves.

<p>
The song I was listening to constantly around the time I made it was
Chvrches's
"<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mTRvJ9fugM&feature=kp">The
Mother We Share</A>". Let's start with the most obvious thing I'm
taking from it: the chord progression of its chorus, I-iii-IV-IV. (And
of course its verse substitutes the relative minor to get a
vi-iii-IV, which shows up in Pachelbel's Canon)

<p>But oh, that I-iii motion. It's something I've liked for a long
time, which might be why I'm such a sucker for the Chvrches song. It
feels like a mellower version of I-III that creates the tension in the
verse of the Pixies song "Wave of Mutilation", and whether you're
dealing with the minor iii or the major III, both slide so nicely into
the IV.

<p>It's in the key of C, which means I hadn't yet begun my compulsive
habit of writing in C and then transposing up (via beepbox's Key
popup, not by actual rewriting) to some other key to achieve a feeling
of harmonic novelty before posting to twitter. I always actually write
in C at first so that I can go back and forth between the beepbox
piano roll and the casio sitting next to my desk and test out other
possibilities without having to actually spend precious brain on
transposition.

<p>Let's talk about rhythm. Lots of things happening on off-beats in
the green instrument &mdash; the one that carries the melody. Probably
I would have had anticipatorily syncopated some of the measure-initial
notes as well if only beepbox supported "ties" or something like that.
The others are more straight ahead, with the exception of the orange
instrument in the last four measures; the octave rise during the last
bit of each part of the phrase, combined with beepbox's "slide" notion
of legato makes for a wobbling sound that I like.

<p>I was still working out how to exploit the sort of things that are
very chiptune-specific, (but which I hadn't much experience with in
composition before) namely portamento and arpeggiation. My favorite
bit is the so-brief arpeggio in pattern 2 of the green instrument that
ends up sounding more like a ornament than expressing a chord. The
cluster of portamentos in the middle of green pattern 7 also feels
like a success, expressing some kind of casualness. The last of the
three is almost inaudible with the decay sharp filter on, since it
occurs at the end of the note and isn't very extreme. Which is too
bad. I'm sure it precedes me switching filters from the (non-decaying)
default.

<p>The overall structure of the song features several ruts that I got
into quickly and am still trying to get out from under. The drums
reliably do a flashy fill every four measures. The density of notes
increases implacably from the intro to nearly the end of 16-bar
repeating section. I think of the switching to a variant melody in the
last 4 (and the sudden drop-out before repeating) as a kind of
"overflow" of this increase. I notice that I switch instruments in the
melody, but I don't think it was particularly necessary. I could have
just taken it up an octave with about the same effect.

<p>Exercises for the reader: can anything more interesting be done
with the yellow instrument? What would be a good bridge? How indeed do
you stop the doubled IV inthe I-iii-IV-IV from leading you straight
back to the I? (or do you let it, and only thereafter go somewhere
else?) Would changing all the other instruments in the last 4 measures
work better than just the one? What happens if the orange instrument
gets more syncopated earlier?
