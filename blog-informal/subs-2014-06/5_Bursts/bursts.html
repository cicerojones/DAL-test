<h3>Making "Bursts"</h3>
<p>I discovered <a href="http://www.beepbox.co">BeepBox</a> in April 2013. In the first few months, I made a whole lot of short experimental chiptunes with it. I still think a lot of them are pretty good! But over time I became dissatisfied with with the quick, unpolished pieces I was coming up with, and I decided to take my time and produce more-complicated compositions less often.</p>

<p>Since then, I've settled into a routine where I write BeepBox tunes over the course of many short sessions. Generally I'll sit down and listen to what I have so far a couple times. Then I might just make a few tweaks and call it good for now, or I might add a whole section or another layer to an existing section, or I might just decide to leave it until I'm more inspired or have more energy to work through a sticky part. Since I never spend very long working on a piece in one sitting, and when I take a break it's usually hours or days before I pick it up again, I'm constantly coming back to it with fresh ears. When I do I often find that I have new ideas, or that the version of the piece that's been running through my head while I've been doing other things is different (and hopefully better!) than what I've actually put down so far.</p>

<p>With "Bursts" I knew I was writing to submit to Method &amp; Apparatus, so I was especially aware of my process, and I ended up with a piece that is in many ways <i>about</i> that process. I saved some of the intermediate stages, so if you click through the links as you read you'll be able to hear some of what this sounded like as a work-in-progress.</p>

<p>My last composition involved a lot of complicated counterpoint and dynamics, so for this project I started out wanting to do something more harmonically transparent and with a lighter feel. I usually start a piece with some kind of melodic or rhythmic hook that I think has the potential to become something interesting, and I pretty quickly found this little <a href="http://www.beepbox.co/#4sbkal0e4t8a7g0fj7i0r1w1111f0000d1111c0000h0000v0000o3210b08000000000000000000000000000000p1YFzM6CAd8qgQkk1EE3E32kxF3i6iwqwMd8g000Fw0yE5gawl0GbHbaMi0ah00">syncopated loop</a>.</p>

<p>It took me a while to decide which direction to go from there. I did get the <a href="http://www.beepbox.co/#4sbkal0e8t8a7g0fj7i0r1w1111f0000d1111c0000h0000v0000o3210b00aa00000808000000ab000000000000p22cgFxQ2318wF1i2GiJ1i2i1i1d7Esem2Q5EagkwGII1i2Q58cIoaoZ1HF3i6Ad550qa0W0MB8qgQxAE6Ec3i42Cv0q2t0q1W0Q4W0M8Z8q2t0qxWgQ4W0Rz2C02awl0G1k2EKIIH180F40">upper melody and baseline</a> settled, and had a general idea that I wanted to write a theme-and-variation, but I was stuck on the idea of transposing the melody around, which I couldn't get to happen in a way I liked.</p>

<p>At some point, I came back to the piece while feeling frustrated about some other things that were going on. In the mood I was in, I didn't like the fast, driving notes and drumbeats, so I wrote something slower and more melancholy into the same file. This turned into the "B" section that recurs throughout the piece. Soon I realized that this more-relaxed section would help let me transition between variations smoothly, and to pull back the energy level between iterations so that each one wouldn't need to work so hard to stand out against the previous one. I wrote the second major variation, with the <a href="http://www.beepbox.co/#4sbkal0est8a7g0vjvi0r1w2411f0000d1111c2010h0000v0000o3210b0000y288wy6gFwy288wy6gFw00000w0080020x24aoW2CexaAH00000008wz04gO5cs0h304gO5cs000000000000048800000004880000p24DgFxQ2318wF1i2GiJ1i2i1i1d7Esem2Q5EagkwGII1i2Q584Q-MOt4xlHFjnY79VA98V2Jdr180000aoZ1HF3i6Ad550qa0W0MB8qgQxAE6Ec3i4q8aWGGGCWGCGOCOyiQRmRllkSRkRmQSkSqGHaGGEaOCGKSCCShQRTlllkSRkRmQSk1BkMV5kmG580Bp8lgaj5aQ2F1sawxgg000apY1E9Q1E7E3gjE30zQxE9Q1G7F3gjE3meCUvldzXwu0qM000ao08G1k2E5gayWOOI4w2AmwBgiE9k4w00000">souped-up middle line</a>, all at once.</p>

<h3>Variation</h3>

<p>From this point I knew the general structure I was aiming for. I abandoned the idea of jumping around between different keys since it never came naturally out of anything I was doing, and instead decided there was going to be a pretty substantial section in the parallel minor mode. Here are a few more points of the piece's development, each from the end of a session where I felt I'd made a lot of progress:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.beepbox.co/#4sbkal0eEt8a7g0Ljvi0r1w2411f0000d1111c2010h0000v0000o3210b0000y288wy6gFwye88zy6gFw02xaBI0000000000008002000w8gx2CewFzEiFaM021z6c80000000000000y2c0h38kNM14c0h38kNM000000g00000000000000000004880000000488126coNz8000000000p27wgFxQ2318wF1i2GiJ1i2i1i1d7Esem2Q5EagkwGII1i2Q584Q-MOt4xlHFjnY79VA98V2Jdr18gYi2E5gagkwGAbMk0F1i3DNMVobgmwF1i2GOM589858aMm0J10wwgkSz21y0GwlwAgsQ6iaA58awsl1wgGgkwI1VC1wbw005cuwRQxF3i6yywd50t0oiAd8qgOk3k61F2d45tllljtljlpjph9qqHqGGGrqGqHqrardllBllk5pjlnrjjr8WqXGGGGrqGqHqra0OGosyGbl2A0iIAaE59yBq1kwK5ggE8i-i6Add9enF3i6CAC001jfwd1ewd0Z0q2t0o4uAd1ewdgZ8q2t0qNQT3WFIvs3M3m0001j015gawl0G1knmmlwA0kyQ4G2l1awBE0A1EcA6i391AQp8cA6i391ASSSRwJ1i3d1Ogcw9U6k3aHoSwrlreQ3pHoSwrlreRtttnKrD0H1BS000000">This snapshot</a> takes us right up to the transition into minor. It's an interesting spot because it shows one of the quirks of beepbox: there's not really a distinction between a pattern that's empty because I haven't filled it in with anything yet, and a pattern that's empty because I want that part to have a rest. Since this piece uses so many patterns, I had to scroll a ways over to figure out what I'd already used, and a few times I forgot which pattern I was using for what and accidentally overwrote it with something else. Here I didn't catch for a while that I'd done this with pattern 3 in the drum line, so the B section has extra percussion that isn't supposed to be there. Later I switched to using pattern 5 as the deliberately-empty pattern in the drum line, because I was also using pattern 5 for this in the middle line and it was easier to remember the same number.</p>

What's interesting here is the last part of the minor section, where there isn't much going on yet except the baseline moving around a little differently. This baseline is the same in the final version, but there's more going on above it so it's harder to notice. These ascending minor thirds reminded me of <a href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/walk-stab-walk-r-e">Walk-Stab-Walk</a>, one of my favorite pieces from the <a href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/music/">Homestuck music project</a>. Walk-Stab-Walk is full of really great melodies and countermelodies, and when I remembered it I took one of those melodies as inspiration for the top line that ended up in this section. I'm really happy with how this part of the piece turned out; I think it's the most exciting section.</p>

<p>We're getting close to the end now. <a href="http://www.beepbox.co/#4sbkal4eYt8a7g0_jvi0r1w2411f0000d1111c2010h0000v1000o3210b0000y288wy6gFwye88zy6gFw02xaBIqVY8AbasWlDeBg000p2C6iRM02000w008248gFzEaoW4GiI00woNz0020x24008002000w8gx6KqY000288M14cxj704gM14cxj700000012488ANRamFiBIqFP25ctVj700000000008g800000008g8126coNzaoVy4gBiRckJj248gx248g80p2ekgFxQ2318wF1i2GiJ1i2i1i1d7Esem2Q5EagkwGII1i2Q584Q-MOt4xlHFjnY79VA98V2Jdr18gYi2E5gagkwGAbMk0F1i3DNMVobgmwF1i2GOM589858aMm0J10wwgkSz21y0GwlwAgsQ6iaA58awsl1wgGgkwI1VC1wbGo_rwaMm0F1i2E4y2h18wwgsQe7c1s2U58agl0K1o2U5Mec33A0J1s2w58aHH0n0K1k3q73C0wwn0L1i2K-U5MbMi84RtajUWWgMtvo92fEqg78O8XGbrGqEXb1RlzEFFIFFzKK7tseWyWWjBFfuKAfxOp_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_BlQwOcyCA6hAkQwOcyD9Oaqgp5Zf8GF1Ap5d8cz8FF1Ap5ejAkQAFJE1IjCRkw000">Here</a> is the snapshot I took a few sessions after the previous one, when I first reached the end of the piece. It's actually pretty close to the final version. Normally I'd sit on an almost-finished chiptune for a while longer than I did here and make gradual tweaks, but for once I had a deadline! And really I think my compositions usually reach a solid place pretty quickly once all the sections are filled in, since I generally do a lot of polish on each section as I'm writing it and the sections immediately surrounding it.</p>

<h3>&amp; Theme</h3>

<p>The structure of "Bursts" mirrors the flow of creative energy I experience over the course of a project. The sections with fast, driving percussion and melody lines are the bursts of excited productivity when I find a good idea or a good flow. The slower parts are the times that I go over and over what I have so far and can't seem to make any progress. The patterns are recognizable but every iteration is a little different: sometimes there's more optimism in the slow sections (like when the middle line joins in); sometimes the excited sections have a different undertone, maybe of relaxed experimentation, maybe of determination to get this chord progression to make sense already.</p>

<p>The piece ends with a double iteration of the slow section, as the project winds down and I do fewer large bursts of work and more tweaking. But there's no real ending: the piece loops right back to the beginning, just as finishing a project often means I'm starting to work on something new.</p>
