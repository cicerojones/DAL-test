This is a little tile automata game thing, and an attempt to learn
LOVE2D/Lua!

Before I knew lua indexed arrays from 1 I made my map like this

  map =
  {{2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2},
   {2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2},
   {0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
   {0,3,3,0,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0},
   {2,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2},
   {2,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,2},
   {2,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,2},
   {2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,2},
   {2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,2},
   {2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,2},
   {2,2,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2}
  }

And my tile array like this

  tiles = {soil, grass, concrete, cracked, water, seed, flower, flower_sad}

And then so much code came to do various adjusting for off-by-one errors that I
just kept it that way, and made myself a little table:

  -- map (0-indexed):
  --        0     1       2         3       4       5     6       7
  -- tiles (1-indexed):
  --        1     2       3         4       5       6     7       8

I never bothered making constants to stand for these elements so a lot of code
looks like

  -- water + cracked => soil
  if map[y][x] == 3 then
    if element == 4 then map[y][x] = 0 end
    if element == 2 then map[y][x] = 2 end
  end
  -- cracked + water => soil
  if map[y][x] == 4 then
    if element == 3 then map[y][x] = 0 end
  end

lua is a very cute language. I don't know why I had the impression it was
esoteric or strange; it's pretty much the most bog-standard imperative language
I can think of. I did learn that arrays are not values though; their vars are
pointers. That's a little bit tricksy.

I wrote the song in beepbox while I was feeling nostalgic for small string
ensembles, and I wrote it as kind of a viola/cello duet.

The mechanic of the game is a variant on some ideas that have been floating
around in my head since I was a tiny child and played the second Legend of
Kyrandia game with the potion-making cauldron. I'm fascinated my the
multitude of ways that you can get just a small set of elements to interact
and do weird stuff.

The first iteration was basically an exercise in frustration. The flowers
wouldn't stay alive and you had to constantly tend to them.

Then I made grass appear over soil randomly sometimes, and flowers appear
over grass randomly sometimes, and that was the OPPOSITE experience:
everything was overgrowing and chaotic and there was no way to tame it. So
maybe not really the opposite; it still doesn't allow the gardener any
sense of control.

So I took out the random-grass-spawning thing and also added bugs that eat
flowers.

I dunno, it still doesn't feel to me anything like what *actual* gardening
feels like: a half hour or so of hard work followed by a long period of
doing nothing. Requires a more careful balance between player agency and
world autonomy. It's interesting to me that that's so difficult to tune
precisely.
