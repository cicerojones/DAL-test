Hello and welcome to Issue 1 of Method & Apparatus!

How to "read" this zine:

1. Use a terminal, a web browser, or a file browser to navigate to the
directory on your computer.  Since you're reading this text, you've
probably done that successfully!

2. Navigate to the subfolders and explore what's in them! If there's a
.html or .txt file, try reading that first. If viewing or interacting with
the content is more complicated than that, those files will contain
further instructions.

Some of the projects have executables that are too large to include
directly in this distribution. Their instructions contain download links to
a Google Drive folder where you can find the application.

3. If you have any problems running or accessing the content in this issue,
please contact methodandapparatus@gmail.com so we can put you in touch with
the author!
