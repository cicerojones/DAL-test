at the museum of unexploded munitions
-------------------------------------

the noise was a monster
from a lost era.

wincing at its bite,
the guard asked
about the knot in her throat
and the socket in her neck.

across the flat water,
sparks of static and
little anxieties
reeked of lichen.

her artificial eyes,
the unblinking eyes of the moon,
went wild.

they watched tv
and prayed.
