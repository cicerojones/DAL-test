Here's a [link to a document I created](https://draftin.com/documents/804308?token=P4OkClU0Bi8qp0AUx8a75m9xOq3FBwB9wZwutzbaYga_g7_1HHseJAY71Uv_q9QeFCWp4U-XW0jA5bbppk13hgM) with y'all in mind (a PDF copy is also attached, but you need to use the website to make edits, which is what I'm encouraging you to do). You will probably need to sign up for an account with Draft in order to make these edits (I chose Draft instead of, say, Google Docs for reasons that will become clear later).

Before I describe the edits, I'll just mention three pedagogical purposes of the exercise:

- One of the first issues you deal with in learning to program is having to look shit up. 
- Another major thing that crops up is sharing work with others and making minor edits--in some cases edits that are just for your purposes, but sometimes edits that would help other people out. 
- A final thing is that you can think of coding as "typing with really strict rules." Forget a semi-colon and you break a website. "Markup languages" (this document is written in one called Markdown, about which you'll need to find out a little ) are rather less strict; they're just about getting text to appear a certain way when it comes time to format it, but writing in one provides a good warm-up to learning to use weird characters and be precise, which programming is all about.


Since there's a lot mentioned in this document that is going completely unexplained here (but which I'll be referring to in the next installment), I would like you to sprinkle in to your version of the document a little info about the bullet-pointed things (which means you will have to look this shit up on the internet. Feel free to be pithy, sarcastic or bemused--the only thing I'd ask is for you to figure out how to add links to things that don't have links (in order to do this you will have to figure out a little about how links in Markdown work). Note that the editor that Draft provides requires you to hit "Cmd R" or "Apple R" (assuming you have a Mac and understand what keyboard shortcuts are) in order to "render" your Markdown--that is, to take the unformatted version with the weird characters and display in a pretty way.

Let me know if you have any problems with this or working with Draft, or if you think I should go fuck myself. Spend only as much time as you care to poking around with any of these things (some of which are more important to understand or use than others), and keep in mind that anything of my own making that I've linked is quite rough. You help me greatly even just by looking at this shit and sneezing as feedback.

I thank you.
Will

PS. I'm trying to keep my emails to 5-6 sentences max; this one is approx twice that, depending on how you slice it. :(
