## Module 3: Starting to programmin from scratch

- Working with [Pure Data, a "data flow programming language"](https://puredata.info)
    - install a pre-compiled binary
    - install and build latest release from source (advanced)

- find a good tutorial and live and die by it
     - http://pd-tutorial.com/english/index.html
        - need to create a guide to using the guide appropriately

- make a small, interactive sound patch (akin to a Processing sketch in many ways, except that you can easily modify it in real time)



## Module 4A: Introduction to (Select) Programming Languages

- the oldest still-talked about programming language (LISP)
    - historical and pedagogical significance
        - understanding functional programming concepts and [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)#Syntax_and_semantics)
        - laying the groundwork [at MIT](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-5.html#%_chap_Temp_2) with [SICP (Sick-Pee)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-7.html)
    - using Lisp(s) today
        - Clojure
        - Common Lisp
        - Scheme/Racket
- the ascendant, default teaching language (Python)
    - basic Python interactions
    - [some comparisons](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/proglang.html) for [teaching's sake](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a.html)
    - exploring natural languages with Python

- the language that's everywhere you want to go (Javascript)
    - write code (to do stupid shit) in your browser

- designing or developing? art vs. engineering
    - [Hackers and Painters](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html)

## Module 4B: Understanding Executable Environments

- The Shell
    - Let's call this (Python script from the command line)
         - [Statements in a script] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science))

- Talking to a REPL (sounds like "Rep-ill")
    - The very model of interactivity
        - [Expressions at the REPL]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science))
       
- The browser
    - Your default platform

## Module 4C: Translate Pd to a Clojure Library(?)

## Module 5A: A Hacker's Palette
### Editors
- emacs (and all the others)
### Resources
- stackoverflow (and free tutorials or books)
### Collaboration
- Distributed Version Control (or, for all practical purposes, git/github)
### Cutting Your Teeth
- Project Euler
- Coder exercises

## Module 5B: Hacker "Culture"
### Free and Open Source Software Movement(s)
(Link to cicero's symposium presentation)
- FSF
- OSI
### Jobs and Interviews
- Understanding algorithms and some Computer Science
- Cracking the Coding Interview (etc)
### Doing the Usual Stuff that People Want
- Making websites
- Making web apps

### Having Fun and Making Beautiful Things
